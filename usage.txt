I plan to populate a few of the motherboards for the Blue Pill unit, with one for the current motor rig.  Here is what it include, you may have other things to add/delete--

1. Flying cap--
  a) Parts and jumpers on mother board:
      JP13 RJ11 for interconnect to perf board with relay, cap, resistor, zener (zener instead of diode to speed drop-out).
      Q8 jumpered to JP13 to drive relay
      U$15 op-amp follower, jumper JP6-3 to JP13 for fly-cap voltage input
      Divider: R33|R34 1M:8.2K -> 400v FS.
  
  b) External perf board:
       Relay:      (I should have one of these I got for evaluation, but I have to find it!)

     Cap 1 uf @ 450v, e.g.

     Resistor to limit charging surge: 1K
     
     Zener: ~12v, onboard fet Vds limit is 20v.  (I'll check my junk box)
     RJ11 plug on cable plugs into the mother board.

2.  Battery current sensor

   a) Parts on board
      JP10 for interconnect fo perf board with current sensor
      R6|R5 5v->3.3v divider. 

   b) External perf board
      Either use +5 in cable from motherboard, or 
       use LM78L05 to regulate/smooth +12v locally.
 
      Big cap, e.g. 100 uf on +5 to sensor.

      Cable with RJ 11 to mother board.
